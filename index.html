            <p>
                My name is Roy Cantu and I am currently working towards becoming a full stack devleoper. I graduated with my bachelors in computer engineering back in 2016, I chose to pursue computer enginnering due
                to my close friend group pursuing electrical engineering and computer science degrees. I was curious on if there was a blend of the two fields and found that computer enginering was a definite fit for me.
                I am currently employed at a mid-level bank in Texas where I am in charge of the EFT network for all debit cards and ATMs. I enjoy solving complex problems and helping out people in anyway that I can. 
                On my free time I enjoy practicing muay thai and lifting weights, I also enjoy traveling and hiking around the United States and looking to travel outside the U.S. in the near future.
